# sharepointmapdrive
Map Sharepoint as webdav drive map
I tried to add a credentials in windows credential manager, but I think the drive map uses the credentials saved by IE.
I just pick a bit of some codes in VBS on broswer and made a script. If you can help me with this code, please do it lol

Is working fine if you follow all the steps, if you know how to code in vbs, you can automate more and more the script. 

TKS :)
